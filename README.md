# Smart Pesticide Blending System


In this era modern technology the population around the world has been increasingly rapidly . As the population is increasing the need of food production is also increasing . And to meet the food production the farmers are using
fertilizers and pesticides to increase the production . But the farmers don’t have
mush knowledge regarding how much quantity of pesticides need to be mixed
with amount of water. Apart from the other requirements in the agricultural
sector, pesticides mixing is one of the basic requirement that is necessary . If
this is not done properly then it may lead to the lose of the fertility of soil in long
term use. Then the soil can never be used for farming even if we use any kind
of pesticides and fertilizers .So, to prevent this kind of scenarios and to increase
the food production we developed a system that mixes pesticides and water
and you don’t need to have much knowledge . You just need to enter the name
and the amount of pesticides. We can enter the amount of pesticides that we
need through Blynk it app (IOT platform ) over Wifi .As it don’t require any hard
physical work farmers will be getting benefit from it .In this proposed system
node-MCU integrates with the relay to control sensors and motors.

## Requirements

Our Proposed system requires the following hardware and software
components:

```Hardware:```
1. NodeMCU
2) Ultrasonic Sensors
3) Pumping motor
4) Connecting pipes
5) Containers
6) DC motor
7) Connecting wires
8) 4-channel relay module



```Software:```

1) Arduino IDE
2) Blynk IOT application
## Blynk-IOT Platform

Internet of Things(Iot) is a booming technology that connects various
things around us through internet or simply we can say Smart things .When we
want to connect our system to mobile we need some intergace through which
we can control the system from any wgere round the world. Blynk is such a
platform through which we can connect our system to it and perform various
operations rihjt from the mobile itself .Blynk platform is very easy to understand
and we could connect our system to the internet through blynk very easily which
is very difficult in other platforms like UBidots.We would be entering the amount
of pesticide that we need and when we enter that amount of pesticide and the
default amount of water will be pushed into the third container which can be
later used for spraying. Internet of Things (IoT) is the organization of actual
articles fit for moving information over network with no manual or framework
obstruction. Blynk is an Internet-of Things based stage created to make brilliant
IoT things. It tends to be utilized to peruse, store, and imagine sensor
information and furthermore to remotely control equipment. The accompanying
are the means continued in making portable application. Download the
Blynkapp and make a Blynk account. After login, make new Project in that. Pick
the equipment on which you are dealing with. The Auth Token will be ship off
your record. Add Gadget from the Widget Box. Run The Project. At the point
when saline jug is going to discharge, Hub MCU sends the warning to the
specialist or medical attendant through versatile application. T
## Key Features of this Project

- We can control our gadget from anywhere round the world by just tapping on Blynk through mobile.
- We will be able to get complete health data on crop .
- We can know the humidity in air, moisture content in soil through which we dry the soil is and how much water can be supplied to it.
- Using the above values as base conditions / reference values our system will be able to calculate the amount of water it requires and it allows the flow of water -only that amount of water its necessary to the fields
